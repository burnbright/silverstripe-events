TODO:

 * Document the module better: Data model diagram. Feature list.
 * Make sure payment module works with multiple modules
 * Move codebase to GitHub
 
 * Create a task that deletes attendees with no registrationid after x days.
 

 * Security fixes: make sure forms can't be hacked (for ticket selection etc)
 * Make MultipleBookings work with attendees TableListField
 		-it doesn't the needed loadDataFrom or a getDataObjectSet functions
 * Modify system to always require one attendee, rather than treating the registration as the attendee data.
 	This makes switching between multi-bookings and single bookings easier.
 * Internationalisation
 * Do something about Ticket scenarios - I'm not sure these even work?
